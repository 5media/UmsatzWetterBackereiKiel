# Data Import and Preparation

## Overview

This stage focuses on importing and preparing the dataset for your bakery sales forecasting project. Efficient and accurate data preparation is fundamental for successful forecasting models. The task includes importing the dataset into R, cleaning it, and constructing new variables that are pertinent to forecasting sales.

## Guidelines

Focus on the following key issues:

-   **Data Importing**

-   **Merging Data from different sources**

-   **Data Cleaning**

-   **Handling Missing Values**

-   **Constructing New Variables** (Develop and integrate new variables that could significantly influence sales predictions. This may include date-related features (like day of the week, holidays), weather conditions, or special events.)

-   **Data Transformation** (e.g., converting metric data to categorical data)

## Task

Create an R-script to conduct the data import and preparation process. Ensure each step is well-documented.
